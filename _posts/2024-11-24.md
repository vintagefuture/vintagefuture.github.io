After a lot of fiddling around, I found a good solution on my Linux Mint (Cinnamon edition) to have a macOS-like copy/paste experience.

- Go to the `Keyboard` section in the settings
- Under `Layouts`, choose `Options...`
- Under `ctrl position`, select `Swap Left Win with Left Ctrl`
- In Terminal, under Settings -> Shortcuts, remap Copy to Ctrl + C and Paste as Ctrl + V
- Install Autokey, and create an entry that maps <ctrl>+<shift>+c to <super>+c
- Done! :-)
