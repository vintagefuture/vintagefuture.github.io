As an Italian, I've always been familiar with the name *Cartesio*.

You spend something like thirteen years in school hearing that name.

During my years as an expat, I've often come across *René Descartes* — that name comes out everywhere.

Today I've discovered that *Cartesio* and *René Descartes* are **the same person**.

`Cartesio == Descartes`

My mind is officially blown.
