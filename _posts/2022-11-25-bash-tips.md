# Copy folder content including hidden files

You can copy the content of a folder /source to another existing folder /dest, including hidden files, with the command:

```bash
$ cp -a /source/. /dest/
```
    
The **-a** option is an improved recursive option, that preserve all file attributes, and also preserve symlinks.

The **.** at end of the source path is a specific cp syntax that allowes to copy all files and folders, including hidden ones.
